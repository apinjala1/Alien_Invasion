Alien_Invasion Game, 

A video game in which the player tries to shoot down alien ships before they are about to enter Earth. Alien ships fly down on the screen while the user tries to shoot them down. If the alien ships manage to touch the user, the game will end and you lose. Used those program's methods to manipulate the objects, giving objects some motion and interactive capabilities. To achieve this I used Pygame and Sprite.
